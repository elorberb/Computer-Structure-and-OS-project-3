# Computer-Structure-and-OS-project-3
Implementing a multi-threaded version of text search in large text file.
The program takes four parameters:
1.textfile
2.StringToSearch
3.nThreads
4.Delta - the delta (distance) between letters to search in the file, if delta is 0 its means no distrance between letters.
If delta is -1 it means arbitrary distance between the letters.
The output of the program is the index of the first occurance od the words in the whole text file.
